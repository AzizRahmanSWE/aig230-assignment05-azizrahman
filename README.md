# AIG 230 – Assignment 5

For this assignment I built an NLP pipeline on Jane Austen's *Emma* from the NLTK Gutenberg corpus. I cleaned the text by lowercasing, removing punctuation and stopwords, then trained a Bigram language model using MLE and evaluated it with perplexity. I also trained Word2Vec embeddings and ran similarity queries and word analogies on the corpus.
